# ESP IDF Setup on Windows 11

ESP-IDF requires some prerequisite tools to be installed so you can build firmware for supported chips. The prerequisite tools include Python, Git, cross-compilers, CMake and Ninja build tools.

Make sure that the path to where you install ESP-IDF fits within the 90 characters limit.

The installation is currently easiest to follow correctly using the ESP-IDF Windows Installer
