# âœ¨ ESP-IDF Setup on Windows 11
This part of the repository describes the necessary steps of setting up ESP-IDF for ESP32 programming and additional tips from our side as a developer working with these chips.

## ESP-IDF Prerequisite Tools
ESP-IDF requires some prerequisite tools to be installed so you can build firmware for supported chips. The prerequisite tools include Python, Git, cross-compilers, CMake and Ninja build tools.

Easiest way to install all the necessary tools is by using Espressif's ESP-IDF Tools installer:
```sh
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/?idf=4.4
```

* Select the green, online option for a faster instalation if you have a sufficiently good internet download speed. Otherwise go for the offline version.
