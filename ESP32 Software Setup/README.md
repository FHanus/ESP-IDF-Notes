# âœ¨ Options of software used to program ESP32
This part of the repository describes the necessary steps of setting up your device for ESP32 programming.
Arduino IDE is not recommended for complex programs as it does not naturally support RTOS. Programming using ESP-IDF has the benefit of flash encryption and secured boot.

The described IDEs for programming:
* Arduino IDE
* PlatformIO IDE
* ESP-IDF
* ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin
