# âœ¨ Example projects with explanations
This part of the repository summarizes the most usefull examples, mostly oriented towards voice commands control.
A couple of the following programs are written for another IDE than ESP-IDF. All of them will eventually be translated to ESP-IDF. Programming using ESP-IDF has the benefit of flash encryption and secured boot. ESP-IDF is the recommended way and most stable and reliable way of programming these microcontrollers.

## The described IDEs for programming:
These are the following IDEs that the examples are written for.
* Arduino IDE
* PlatformIO IDE
* ESP-IDF

## Featured Projects:
* Voice Recorder - Suitable for voice recording, dataset creation for training voice recognition neural networks.
